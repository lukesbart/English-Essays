Cassius, A True Tragic Hero

Cassius was a noble Roman who through jealous or justified worry went down a path that destoryed him and all those he in which he shared his mission. Cassius had an excellent plan to bring down the possible tyranny of his associate Julius Caesar, but through his own missteps and the influence of others in his plan, most notibly Brutus, he was led to defeat and death. Cassius had an internal struggle with himself about wether Caesar would actually be a tyrant and eventually hedecided to try to kill Caesar. In this essay I will discuss the internal struggles Cassius had with his plan, how his associates dismantled his potentially good plan, and how this all led to his death.

In the beggining of "Julius Caesar", Cassius did not think that Caesar would have been a tyrant but, like Brutus his decision laid in the what if of Caesars power corrupting him.

Cassius' biggest flaw leading to his downfall is his disposition to give up too easily.

Cassius wanted the death of Antony, but Brutus decided that the death of Caesar was sufficient. Cassius also wanted to prevent Antony from speaking at the funeral of Caesar, but Brutus decided against this, saying that if Brutus himself gave a speach it would be enough to keep the people on their side. But Brutus paid no attention to the danger Antony could have posed and let Antony alone to speak to the people and Antony managed to convince the people of Rome to rise against the conspirators.

Cassius was an honorable, shrewd man who let his admiration for Brutus get the better of him and let Brutus dismantle the tightly knit plan the Cassius had made. I very much enjoyed the text Julius Caesar. It helped me expand my view of Caesar, Brutus, and the late Roman Republic. An interesting fact about late Rome was that the First Triumvirate were not the three main leaders of Rome, but were an informal alliance, bent on taking over the Roman Republic. The actual rulers of the late Roman Republic were the two Roman Consuls.
