Cassius, A True Tragic Hero

	Cassius was a noble Roman who through jealous or justified worry went down a path that destroyed him and all those he in which he shared his mission. Cassius had an excellent plan to bring down the possible tyranny of his associate Julius Caesar, but through his own missteps and the influence of others in his plan, most notably Brutus, he was led to defeat and death. Cassius had an internal struggle with himself about wether Caesar would actually be a tyrant and eventually he decided to try to kill Caesar. In this essay I will discuss the internal struggles Cassius had with his plan, how his associates dismantled his potentially good plan, and how this all led to his death.

	Cassius’ involvement in the death of Caesar came when he made the realization that Caesar wanted full power over Rome, and would probably do anything to get the lower classes on his side in the struggle against the Senate. At first, Cassius does not think that Caesar would be a tyrannical ruler “insert quote here” - I.I.240?. Cassius decides that he will stop Caesar from taking over the Republic and not bear his yoke, ‘Lest it make him be womanish’ - find quote.

	Cassius decides to persuade several other members of the Senate to join him in assassinating Julius Caesar. As an attempt to gather public support, Cassius attempts and succeeds and persuading the ‘most honorable man in Rome’ to join in his deed. The conspirators succeed in their mission of killing Caesar, but unfortunately for Cassius, this is only where his fate has just begun. Brutus affected the outcome of events in a way even he could not have seen.

	The fate and reputation of the conspirators is potentially one of glory, saving the Republic from the tyranny of Caesar. But their fates turn to their downfall. Brutus sets off this process by insisting Antony be kept alive then leaving him with the crowd at the funeral of Caesar. Antony succeeds in turning the crowd against Cassius, Brutus, and the conspirators. After this, Cassius 
and Antony engage in civil war. The Republicans have the advantage at first, but because of Brutus’ decisions, they give up their advantage. 

At the end of the play Cassius and Brutus see their missions and being hopeless and come to the mutual understanding that they will never see each other again, and bid their farewells. Cassius feels like he will face an unavoidable punishment for orchestrating the death of Caesar and kills himself.

	Cassius was an honorable, shrewd man who let his admiration for Brutus get the better of him and let Brutus dismantle the tightly knit plan the Cassius had made. I very much enjoyed the text Julius Caesar. It helped me expand my view of Caesar, Brutus, and the late Roman Republic. An interesting fact about late Rome was that the First Triumvirate were not the three main leaders of Rome, but were an informal alliance, bent on taking over the Roman Republic. The actual rulers of the late Roman Republic were the two Roman Consuls.
